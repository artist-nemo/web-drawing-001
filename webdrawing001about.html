            <p class="lead">Art by Instruction, like Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawings</p>

	   <p>
	   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt">Sol LeWitt</a> was an American artist (born in Hartford, Connecticut) often regarded as the founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_art" target="blank">Conceptual</a> and Minimal art. Some of his most famous works were wall drawings for which he only provided instructions:
            
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <em>Wall Drawing #65 (1971)</em>
	    <p>Lines not short, not straight, crossing and touching, drawn at random, using four colors, <br>
	    uniformly dispersed with maximum density, covering the entire surface of the wall.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <p>
	  That's the art! He didn't actually execute the drawing himself.<br><br>

	  Usually the art was just a <strong>Certificate with the instructions</strong>.

	  <h2>Web drawing (with the public)</h2>

	  <p>So I created my own <strong>art as instructions</strong> for a publically accessible web page that will contain tiles created and submitted by the public.<br><br>

	  The web page is here:  <a href="https://luxelorev.com/webdrawing001.html">https://luxelorev.com/webdrawing001.html</a><br><br>

	  The Instructions are here:<br>
          <blockquote>
            <a name="instructions"><em>Web Drawing #001 (2019)</em></a>
	    <p>Populate a web page with 20 x 20 tiles, with each tile having a white background.<br>
	    Each tile will have four lines from one side to another, in one direction only.<br>
	    Each line must be a different color.<br>
	    </p>
          </blockquote>

	  I am collecting tiles from the public, so you can add to this work of art, with a computer or even a smart phone!<br>
          </p>
	  <h3>How to make a tile and submit it for the web page</h3>

	  <h4>#### Step #1</h4>
	  <ul>
		  <li> Laptop (Microsoft Windows):<br>
		  Use Paint and create a tile no bigger than 768x1024 and save as a png or jpg file.  Use the biggest line size so it will stand out.<br><br></li>
		  <li> Laptop (MacOS/Linux): <br>
		  Use <a href=https://www.gimp.org/downloads/" target="blank">GiMP</a>(FREE) and create a tile no bigger than 768x1024 and save as a png file.<br><br></li>
		  <li> iPhone:<br>
		  Use ??? and create a tile no bigger than 768x1024 and save as a png or jpg file.<br><br></li>
		  <li> Android Phone:<br>
		  Use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ng_labs.paint" target="blank">Paint by ng-labs</a>(FREE) and create a tile no bigger than 1440x2560 and save as a png file.<br><br>
                   </li>
	   </ul>
	   <h4>#### Step #2</h4>
	   <p>Follow the instructions for the tile (<a href="#instructions">above</a>).
	   <blockquote>
		   <p> ... each tile having a white background.<br>
		   Each tile will have four lines from one side to another, in one direction only.<br>
		   Each line must be a different color.<br>
	           </p>
	   </blockquote>

	   <h4>#### Step #3</h4>
	   <p>Email the tile to me at <a href="mailto:nemo@luxelorev.com">nemo@luxelorev.com</a> and let me know if you want your first name to be displayed.<br><br>

	   Thanks in advance if you send a tile.<br><br>

	   Yay! You have now helped to create a new piece of art.<br><br><br>
