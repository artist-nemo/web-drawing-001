web-drawing #001 - Art by Instruction, like Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawings

by Nemo <nemo@luxelorev.com>

## Sol LeWitt

[Sol LeWitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt) was an American artist often regarded as the founder of [__Conceptual__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_art) and Minimal art. Some of his most famous works were wall drawings for which he only provided instructions:
            
```
            Wall Drawing #65 (1971)
            Lines not short, not straight, crossing and touching, drawn at random, using four colors, uniformly dispersed with maximum density, covering the entire surface of the wall.
```

That's the art! He didn't actually execute the drawing himself.

Usually the art was just a Certificate with the instruction.

## Web drawing (with the public)

So I created my own instructions for a web page that will contain tiles created and submitted by the public.

The web page is here:  https://nemo.luxelorev.com/webdrawing001

The Instructions are here:
```
            Web Drawing #001 (2019)

```

Feel free to send a tile.
