web-drawing #001 - Art by Instruction, like Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawings

by Nemo <nemo@luxelorev.com>

## Sol LeWitt

[Sol LeWitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt) was an American artist (born in Hartford, Connecticut) often regarded as the founder of [__Conceptual__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_art) and Minimal art. Some of his most famous works were wall drawings for which he only provided instructions:
            
```
            Wall Drawing #65 (1971)
            Lines not short, not straight, crossing and touching, drawn at random, 
            using four colors, uniformly dispersed with maximum density, covering
            the entire surface of the wall.
```

That's the art! He didn't actually execute the drawing himself.

Usually the art was just a Certificate with the instruction.

## Web drawing (with the public)

So I created my own art as instructions for a web page that will contain tiles created and submitted by the public.

The web page is here:  https://luxelorev.com/webdrawing001

                       https://tinyurl.com/nemo2019

The Instructions are here:
```
            Web Drawing #001 (2019)
            Populate a web page with 20 x 20 tiles, with each tile having a white background.
            Each tile will have four lines from one side to another, in one direction only.
            Each line must be a different color.
```

I am collecting tiles from the public, so you can add to this work of art.

### How to make a tile

#### Step #1
- Laptop (Microsoft Windows):
    Use Paint and create a tile no bigger than 768x1024 and save as a png or jpg file.  Use the biggest line size so it will stand out.

- Laptop (MacOS/Linux): 
    Use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)(FREE) and create a tile no bigger than 768x1024 and save as a png file.

- iPhone (iOS):
    Use ??? and create a tile no bigger than 768x1024 and save as a png or jpg file.

- Android Phone:
    Use [Paint by ng-labs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ng_labs.paint)(FREE) and create a tile no bigger than 1440x2560 and save as a png file.

#### Step #2
   Follow the instructions (above).

#### Step #3
   Email the tile to me at nemo@luxelorev.com and let me know if you want your first name to be displayed.

Thanks in advance if you send a tile.

You have now helped to create a new piece of art.
